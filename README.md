### Scholars@Duke author network navigation prototype

Angela Zoss and I are using data from Larry Carin's group at Duke to try to visualize and navigate a network of scholars at Duke. Specifically, Piyush Rai and Changwei Hu supplied us with data on author similarity based on new algorithms developed in Larry Carin's lab.

I've been testing this by running a simple Python server in the developement directory:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
```

and then navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:8888/scholars_network_prototype.html](http://127.0.0.1:8888/scholars_network_prototype.html)
